[{"content":"       Introduction Originally published on Kaggle\nOn February 24th 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukrainian soil. Months before the invasion Russia started moving its troops closer to the Ukrainian border. According to the US government Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. Many analysts believed that war would end very quick resulting in Russia’s victory. However, 2 months after the invasion began, Russia not only didn’t destroy Ukrainian forces, there is a good chance now for Russia to lose this war. There are a lot of reasons why Russia failed but here I would to focus on the information about Russian losses after these two months of war. You can also get familiar with the data in a shiny app here\nSoldiers Counting the losses is not an easy task especially during a full scale war. There are several aspects that make it difficult. While the war is still going, each side wants to look better and keep its soldiers and civilians moral so they tend to exaggerate the enemy losses while understating its own casualties. Russia doesn’t like to talk about its losses and does not give weekly updates. After the first month they confirmed 1351 killed and 3825 wounded soldiers. At approximately the same time NATO estimated 7.000 to 15.000 killed and up to 40.000 in total killed, wounded, taken or missing. The Ukrainian number at this point was about 15.000 which aligns more closely with NATO estimates. Another problem as I said before the war is not stopping after each firefight. Depending on the level of communication some units are just not able to report enemy’s losses correctly. Especially if the unit was destroyed. There are some features of this war that help to get numbers in real time: we have a lot of drone footage or analysis of the Russian social networks to identify soldiers who didn’t come back. But the point is that it’s quite difficult to know the precise numbers.\n {\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"6d323f209093\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"6d323f209093\",\"attrs\":{\"6d323f209093\":{\"x\":{},\"y\":{},\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"text\":{},\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"bar\",\"inherit\":true}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"xaxis\":{\"domain\":[0,1],\"automargin\":true,\"title\":\"Date\"},\"yaxis\":{\"domain\":[0,1],\"automargin\":true,\"title\":\"Number per Day\"},\"title\":\"Amount of Personnel Lost per Day\",\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":false},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"modeBarButtonsToAdd\":[\"hoverclosest\",\"hovercompare\"],\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"x\":[\"2022-02-26\",\"2022-02-27\",\"2022-02-28\",\"2022-03-01\",\"2022-03-02\",\"2022-03-03\",\"2022-03-04\",\"2022-03-05\",\"2022-03-06\",\"2022-03-07\",\"2022-03-08\",\"2022-03-09\",\"2022-03-10\",\"2022-03-11\",\"2022-03-12\",\"2022-03-13\",\"2022-03-14\",\"2022-03-15\",\"2022-03-16\",\"2022-03-17\",\"2022-03-18\",\"2022-03-19\",\"2022-03-20\",\"2022-03-21\",\"2022-03-22\",\"2022-03-23\",\"2022-03-24\",\"2022-03-25\",\"2022-03-26\",\"2022-03-27\",\"2022-03-28\",\"2022-03-29\",\"2022-03-30\",\"2022-03-31\",\"2022-04-01\",\"2022-04-02\",\"2022-04-03\",\"2022-04-04\",\"2022-04-05\",\"2022-04-06\",\"2022-04-07\",\"2022-04-08\",\"2022-04-09\",\"2022-04-10\",\"2022-04-11\",\"2022-04-12\",\"2022-04-13\",\"2022-04-14\",\"2022-04-15\",\"2022-04-16\",\"2022-04-17\",\"2022-04-18\",\"2022-04-19\",\"2022-04-20\",\"2022-04-21\",\"2022-04-22\"],\"y\":[1500,200,800,410,130,3160,166,834,1000,0,1000,0,0,0,0,0,0,1500,300,200,200,200,300,300,300,300,200,300,300,200,400,200,100,200,200,0,300,300,200,100,300,100,100,200,200,100,200,100,100,100,200,300,200,100,100,1000],\"hoverinfo\":[\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\",\"text\"],\"text\":[\"Date: 2022-02-26 Units: 1500\",\"Date: 2022-02-27 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-02-28 Units: 800\",\"Date: 2022-03-01 Units: 410\",\"Date: 2022-03-02 Units: 130\",\"Date: 2022-03-03 Units: 3160\",\"Date: 2022-03-04 Units: 166\",\"Date: 2022-03-05 Units: 834\",\"Date: 2022-03-06 Units: 1000\",\"Date: 2022-03-07 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-08 Units: 1000\",\"Date: 2022-03-09 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-10 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-11 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-12 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-13 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-14 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-03-15 Units: 1500\",\"Date: 2022-03-16 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-17 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-18 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-19 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-20 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-21 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-22 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-23 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-24 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-25 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-26 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-03-27 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-28 Units: 400\",\"Date: 2022-03-29 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-03-30 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-03-31 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-01 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-02 Units: 0\",\"Date: 2022-04-03 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-04-04 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-04-05 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-06 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-07 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-04-08 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-09 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-10 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-11 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-12 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-13 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-14 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-15 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-16 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-17 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-18 Units: 300\",\"Date: 2022-04-19 Units: 200\",\"Date: 2022-04-20 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-21 Units: 100\",\"Date: 2022-04-22 Units: 1000\"],\"type\":\"bar\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\",\"line\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\"}},\"error_y\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\"},\"error_x\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\"},\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Here we can see that a lot of heavy fights happened in the beginning of the war.

Probably everyone who has the internet saw a bunch of photos of destroyed Russian tanks, especially ones that get decapitated. One thing about lost tanks is that it is easier to get a better number. Tanks are quite big and easier to identify using footage we get from the ground and numerous drones. For example here you can find documented Russian equipment losses in Ukraine. For each destroyed tank or other military equipment there is a photo so it makes it way easier to identify and confirm losses. So we can see that Javelins and other anti-tank weapons provided to Ukranians work very well against Russian tanks. But unlike Germany that has only two thousand tanks, Russia has about 22 thousand. Of course, we don’t know how many of them are actually able to fight, but the point is: Russia can afford to lose thousands of tanks.\n Aircrafts As war started Russia almost immediately claimed air superiority and that it destroyed Ukrainian air forces. Although we didn’t really see massive use of Russian planes. Moreover, we see a lot of footage of Russian jets and helicopters being taken down. As javelins are effective against tanks stingers doing a pretty good job shooting aircrafts.\n {\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"6d32501a7ad\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"6d32501a7ad\",\"attrs\":{\"6d32501a7ad\":{\"x\":{},\"y\":{},\"color\":{},\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"bar\",\"inherit\":true}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"barmode\":\"stack\",\"xaxis\":{\"domain\":[0,1],\"automargin\":true,\"title\":\"Date\"},\"yaxis\":{\"domain\":[0,1],\"automargin\":true,\"title\":\"Number per Day\"},\"title\":\"Aircrafts Lost per Day\",\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":true},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"modeBarButtonsToAdd\":[\"hoverclosest\",\"hovercompare\"],\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"x\":[\"2022-02-26\",\"2022-02-27\",\"2022-02-28\",\"2022-03-01\",\"2022-03-02\",\"2022-03-03\",\"2022-03-04\",\"2022-03-05\",\"2022-03-06\",\"2022-03-07\",\"2022-03-08\",\"2022-03-09\",\"2022-03-10\",\"2022-03-11\",\"2022-03-12\",\"2022-03-13\",\"2022-03-14\",\"2022-03-15\",\"2022-03-16\",\"2022-03-17\",\"2022-03-18\",\"2022-03-19\",\"2022-03-20\",\"2022-03-21\",\"2022-03-22\",\"2022-03-23\",\"2022-03-24\",\"2022-03-25\",\"2022-03-26\",\"2022-03-27\",\"2022-03-28\",\"2022-03-29\",\"2022-03-30\",\"2022-03-31\",\"2022-04-01\",\"2022-04-02\",\"2022-04-03\",\"2022-04-04\",\"2022-04-05\",\"2022-04-06\",\"2022-04-07\",\"2022-04-08\",\"2022-04-09\",\"2022-04-10\",\"2022-04-11\",\"2022-04-12\",\"2022-04-13\",\"2022-04-14\",\"2022-04-15\",\"2022-04-16\",\"2022-04-17\",\"2022-04-18\",\"2022-04-19\",\"2022-04-20\",\"2022-04-21\",\"2022-04-22\"],\"y\":[17,0,2,0,1,0,3,6,5,2,2,1,0,8,1,16,3,4,3,2,7,2,1,1,2,2,7,7,2,4,2,4,4,4,8,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,1,1,2,3,1,2,3,0,2,2,2,2,1,4],\"type\":\"bar\",\"name\":\"Aircrafts\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(102,194,165,1)\",\"line\":{\"color\":\"rgba(102,194,165,1)\"}},\"textfont\":{\"color\":\"rgba(102,194,165,1)\"},\"error_y\":{\"color\":\"rgba(102,194,165,1)\"},\"error_x\":{\"color\":\"rgba(102,194,165,1)\"},\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"frame\":null},{\"x\":[\"2022-02-26\",\"2022-02-27\",\"2022-02-28\",\"2022-03-01\",\"2022-03-02\",\"2022-03-03\",\"2022-03-04\",\"2022-03-05\",\"2022-03-06\",\"2022-03-07\",\"2022-03-08\",\"2022-03-09\",\"2022-03-10\",\"2022-03-11\",\"2022-03-12\",\"2022-03-13\",\"2022-03-14\",\"2022-03-15\",\"2022-03-16\",\"2022-03-17\",\"2022-03-18\",\"2022-03-19\",\"2022-03-20\",\"2022-03-21\",\"2022-03-22\",\"2022-03-23\",\"2022-03-24\",\"2022-03-25\",\"2022-03-26\",\"2022-03-27\",\"2022-03-28\",\"2022-03-29\",\"2022-03-30\",\"2022-03-31\",\"2022-04-01\",\"2022-04-02\",\"2022-04-03\",\"2022-04-04\",\"2022-04-05\",\"2022-04-06\",\"2022-04-07\",\"2022-04-08\",\"2022-04-09\",\"2022-04-10\",\"2022-04-11\",\"2022-04-12\",\"2022-04-13\",\"2022-04-14\",\"2022-04-15\",\"2022-04-16\",\"2022-04-17\",\"2022-04-18\",\"2022-04-19\",\"2022-04-20\",\"2022-04-21\",\"2022-04-22\"],\"y\":[19,0,3,0,2,0,6,3,8,20,12,1,0,2,0,3,4,5,13,0,4,3,3,3,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,0,1,1,1,3,0,1,2],\"type\":\"bar\",\"name\":\"Helicopters\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(141,160,203,1)\",\"line\":{\"color\":\"rgba(141,160,203,1)\"}},\"textfont\":{\"color\":\"rgba(141,160,203,1)\"},\"error_y\":{\"color\":\"rgba(141,160,203,1)\"},\"error_x\":{\"color\":\"rgba(141,160,203,1)\"},\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  What do we have now So far we can see that the attempt to quickly take the Ukraine failed and Russia has lost more soldiers than it did during both Chechen wars together. But it doesn’t mean Russia has lost and is ready to stop. Russia is a very big country that has a lot of reserves and can keep throwing soldiers and equipment into Ukraine for quite a long time. Ukraine on the other hand is backed by Western countries that pledged to supply the Ukrainian army with equipment and ammunition. So, unless it turns into a nuclear annihilation this is going to be a long war.\n Where is it all going? Anybody who has studied the history of armed conflicts knows that it’s always easy to start a war, the problem is nobody knows how to stop it. There’s no clear scenario where both sides agree to a ceasefire. Russian propaganda is completely focused on convincing its people that they have to keep fighting. Taking the whole Ukraine looks highly unlikely but even if Russia somehow occupies the Donbas region Ukranians will not stop fighting. Looks like both sides are ready for the war of attrition. Under the economic sanctions and even if there’s a gas embargo Russia has enough resources to keep fighting. Sadly, we are going to see more people die and more cities destroyed.\n  ","permalink":"https://nikita-kaymonov.netlify.app/post/2022-05-06-kaggle-two-months-in-ukraine-for-russian-military/","summary":"Introduction Originally published on Kaggle\nOn February 24th 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukrainian soil. Months before the invasion Russia started moving its troops closer to the Ukrainian border. According to the US government Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. Many analysts believed that war would end very quick resulting in Russia’s victory. However, 2 months after the invasion began, Russia not only didn’t destroy Ukrainian forces, there is a good chance now for Russia to lose this war.","title":"[Kaggle] Two months in Ukraine for Russian Military"},{"content":" Coffee quality prediction Originally published on Kaggle\nIntroduction Hi, I’m Nikita. I love good coffee. You probably have seen a lot of specialty cafes around (or probably sitting in one right now while reading this and drinking your Geisha coffee made in Chemex). For coffee to be put in the “specialty” category it has to be graded higher than 80 points on a 100 point scale. People who taste and grade coffee are trained specialists (like wine sommeliers) called q-graders. They can evaluate the quality and defects of green beans, find potential mistakes in coffee roasting and identify different roasts. I don’t have highly developed sensory skills needed to be a grader. But I have other skills. So why not use machine learning to grade the coffee?\nSounds interesting to you? Check out this analysis!\nYou can find the dataset here\n Country of origin We have a lot of countries, let’s see what are the most popular countries of origin\nHere we see that a lot of coffee in this dataset comes from Americas\n Proccessing methods Most of the coffee in the dataset is processed using washing method. Which can be explained by the most popular countries our coffee comes from. Dry method is more common in countries like Ethiopia or Brazil where the water is expensive so they just leave beans in the sun right after picking.\nHere Brazil is the only country where dry processing methods is more common. As we mentioned before it often happens in regions with limited access to water and Brazil is one of these regions. Although it can have a lot of advantages when we talk about the taste. Dried coffee tends to have a rich and heavy body, which many coffee drinkers prefer. Also it allows to experiment with different fermentation techniques.\n Coffee quality Not all coffee tastes the same. And some beans are better than others. After graders taste the beans they assign grades to it. The widely accepted definition of specialty coffee is coffee scoring 80 points or above on a 100-point scale. Coffee scoring from 90–100 is graded Outstanding, coffee that scores 85–89.99 is graded Excellent, while coffee scoring 80–84.99 is graded Very Good. Everything lower than that doesn’t fall into “Specialty’ category.\nThe highest grading point we have in this dataset is 89.92. Which means we don’t really have bags with ‘outstanding’ coffee. There are some “excellent” coffees but most bags fall into the ‘Very Good’ category. Which means only 13.5% of our coffee is not ‘Specialty Coffee’. So if you would randomly pick a bag from our dataset most likely you will enjoy your cup of coffee (assuming you know how to brew it).\n Modelling As I showed above, coffee comes from different countries and is processed using different methods. There are also other variables like the altitude where coffee grows, different types of defects beans have etc. To sell our beans to good cafes we need to find a trained person who would taste our coffee and assign the grade. Instead of training a person we can just train a machine and then use it to assign grades to new coffee. So below you’ll find my model that does exactly this.\n  Building predictive models Test/train split Let’s start with splitting data into test and train sets, so we don’t predict on the same data we used for training and our model is actually good for predicting.\ncoffee_sub \u0026lt;- coffee_sub%\u0026gt;% select(-id) set.seed(150) rows \u0026lt;- sample(nrow(coffee_sub)) # Randomly order data shuffled_coffee \u0026lt;- coffee_sub[rows,] # Determine row to split on: split split \u0026lt;- round(nrow(coffee_sub) * .80) # Create train train \u0026lt;- shuffled_coffee[1:split,] # Create test test \u0026lt;- shuffled_coffee[(split +1):nrow(shuffled_coffee),]  Cross validation model Let’s try lm model with cross validation. It’s a good start.\nset.seed(66) # Fit lm model using 10-fold CV: model model_cv \u0026lt;- train( total.cup.points ~., coffee_sub, method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, trControl = trainControl( method = \u0026quot;cv\u0026quot;, number = 10, verboseIter = TRUE ) ) p \u0026lt;- predict(model_cv, test) To evaluate a regression model I like to use RMSE(root mean square error). The smaller here is better.\nerror \u0026lt;- p - test[,\u0026quot;total.cup.points\u0026quot;] rmse_cv \u0026lt;- sqrt(mean(error$total.cup.points^2)) #SD = 1.722239 rmse_cv ## [1] 1.30227 Good start, but we want RMSE that less than standard deviation in dataset, so let’s try Random Forest\n Random forest set.seed(60) model_rf \u0026lt;- train( total.cup.points ~., tuneLength = 1, data = coffee_sub, method = \u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot;, trControl = trainControl( method = \u0026quot;cv\u0026quot;, number = 5, verboseIter = TRUE ) ) p \u0026lt;- predict(model_rf, test) And calculate RMSE\nerror \u0026lt;- p - test[,\u0026quot;total.cup.points\u0026quot;] # Calculate RMSE rmse_rf \u0026lt;- sqrt(mean(error$total.cup.points^2)) # rmse_rf ## [1] 0.8921845 So we got RMSE 1.261236 which is a pretty good result given SD = 2.610294. Since hiring q-graders can be expensive, some coffee farmers can actually use machine learning for grading their coffee.\nNext step Having some newer data and wrapping this model into Shiny app and you can just input the info on whatever beans you have and get pretty accurate grades 🙂\n   ","permalink":"https://nikita-kaymonov.netlify.app/post/2022-05-01-kaggle-specialty-cofee-grades/","summary":"Coffee quality prediction Originally published on Kaggle\nIntroduction Hi, I’m Nikita.
