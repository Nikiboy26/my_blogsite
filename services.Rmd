My data journey started when I took statistics with R class during my psychology master program. Since then I have been obsessed with all the data science related things.

If you are interested in my stance about R vs. Python: I use both. I like learning and trying new things, so why limit myself? Saying that, I do have a personal preference for R. I just feel comfortable using it for most of the tasks and I keep learning new cool things I can use it for.

### Technology Stack
**Computer Languages:** R, Python SQL\
**Skills:** Statistical experimentation, A/B testing, Machine Learning, Data Analysis\
**Cool packages**: Shiny, Plotly, Caret\
**Human Languages**: English, Russian, German (*If your team is multinational* ðŸ™‚)


_**Note**_: These are technologies I am most comfortable with, if you didnâ€™t find something here thereâ€™s a high chance Iâ€™m learning it right now.
