Hi there! :wave: I'm Nikita.

If you landed at this page you most likely have some interest in me.  

As a kid I used to read a lot of encyclopedias to learn about everything. Later during my master's studies I took a class in statistics with R and open the whole new world of Data Science. Being able to analyse any piece of data that I'm curious about was like obtaining a God-like power. 

Learning is my hobby and I'm always learning something new. 
If you are interested in my tech skills, just go to the [Technology Stack](../services/#technology-stack) section of my Services page.
So, in case you would like to hire me, that information might prove useful for
you! :heart:

I am a very curious person and have a wide range of interests besides data science. I love to travel and discover new places, cultures and especially new foods. I am also a very active person so my perfect place to live has a forest and a lot of mountains to hike (like in Colorado or Switzerland :mountain:)\
I also have a little obsession with foxes, but you probably noticed that ðŸ™‚
