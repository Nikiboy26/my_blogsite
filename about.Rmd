Hi there! :wave: I'm Nikita.

If you landed at this page you most likely have some interest in me.  

I fell in love with data science as soon as I took my first R statistics class at my psychology master program. It sucks I didn't know about Data Science before but this is my path and I learned a lot of other things before I got here. 

Learning is my hobby and I'm always learning something new. 
If you are interested in my tech skills, just go to the [Technology Stack](../services/#technology-stack) section of my Services page.
So, in case you would like to hire me, that information might prove useful for
you! :heart:

I am a very curious person and have a wide range of interests besides data science. I love to travel and discover new places, cultures and especially new foods. I am also a very active person so my perfect place to live has forest and a lot of mountains to hike (like Colorado or Switzerland :mountain:)\
I also have a little obsession with foxes, but you probably noticed that ðŸ™‚
